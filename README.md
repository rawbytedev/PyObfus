# PyObfus

This script automates the process of converting a Python script into a compiled C extension using Cython, and then applying PyArmor for additional obfuscation. The goal is to make the Python script significantly harder to reverse-engineer and tamper with.

## Features

- **Cython Compilation**: Converts Python scripts to compiled C extensions.
- **PyArmor Obfuscation**: Further obfuscates the compiled script to enhance security.
- **Automated Process**: Handles the entire process from start to finish with minimal user intervention.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Cython
- PyArmor

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/automated-obfuscation.git
    cd automated-obfuscation
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Automation Script**:
    ```sh
    python automate.py your_script.py
    ```

2. **Parameters**:
    - `your_script.py`: The Python script you want to obfuscate.

3. **Output**:
    - The script will generate a compiled and obfuscated version of your Python script.

## Example

1. **Original Script**: `example.py`
    ```python
    print("Hello, World!")
    ```

2. **Run the Automation**:
    ```sh
    python automate.py example.py
    ```

3. **Result**:
    - `example.c`: The C file generated by Cython.
    - `example.so` (or `.pyd` on Windows): The compiled extension.
    - `dist/example.exe`: The obfuscated executable generated by PyArmor.
